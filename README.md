# Project Management – Robot Kiosk System Analysis & Design  

## Project Overview  
Our team is developing a hypothetical **autonomous kiosk robot system**, designed to enhance the retail experience by offering:  
- **Self-checkout** – customers can scan and pay for items directly at the robot.  
- **Inventory management** – the robot autonomously navigates aisles to scan shelves and track stock levels.  
- **Product lookup** – customers can interact with the robot to locate specific products.  

When not assisting customers, the robot will resume its inventory management duties.  

## Business Need  
Modern retail stores face challenges such as:  
- Long checkout lines  
- Limited customer assistance  
- Inefficient inventory tracking  

This system addresses these issues by automating key processes. The biggest benefit is **reduced labor costs**, as checkout, inventory, and product inquiries will be managed by the robot. Additionally, automated inventory tracking will be more accurate than manual methods, creating more efficient operations.
